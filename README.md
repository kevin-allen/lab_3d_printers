# lab_3d_printers

These are the instructions that you should follow when using the 3D printers. There is a section for the SL1 (resin) printers and one for the MK2 or MK3 (filament) printers.

## Register 

All users of the printer should be part of the 3d_printing channel on Slack. Ask Kevin if you are not part of the channel.

We keep a record of each prints in a [Google document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FGzdYLM6jrgUNTdj_JiCUnRUc9556kP5pb-WygoUFwE/edit?usp=sharing). Write down your name, date, printer and material used. There is a status colum to leave notes about the status of the printers (before or after use).

Scan the qr code to go to the registration Google document.

If you notice any damage to the printers, please report it in the Slack 3d_printing group.

## Keep the space clean and functional

After using the printer, please take time to clean so that the space and printers are in perfect state for the next user. Instructions for cleaning are listed below.

Every user should clean the bench top with 70% alcohol after use.  There should be no filament, support material or resin left on the bench top.
